= Explore datafy / nav with next.jdbc

Spelling out in code, what is described by Sean Corfield in the https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc/blob/master/doc/datafy-nav-and-schema.md#user-content-identifying-foreign-keys[Identifying Foreign Keys section of the next.jdbc docs] -- navigating from one table to another using https://github.com/cognitect-labs/REBL-distro[REBL]

Assumes one can get REBL running.  See Sean Corfield's https://github.com/seancorfield/dot-clojure[~/.clojure/deps.edn] for rebl-* aliases.  FWIW, I used :rebl-11 for these explorations.
